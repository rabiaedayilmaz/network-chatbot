1. Why is my Wi-Fi device not connecting to the router?
Mismatched Wi-Fi security settings between your router and device can cause connection issues. Ensure the following settings are consistent across all devices:
Network mode: Set the router to "mixed mode" to support all device versions.
Security mode: Ensure all devices use the same security protocol (WPA, WPA2, etc.).
Security key: Use the correct passphrase recognized by the router.






2. How can I fix MAC address filtering issues?
Check the router’s settings to ensure:
MAC address filtering is turned off, or
Your device’s MAC address is added to the allowed list.





3. What should I check if my network suddenly stops working?
Ensure power strips are switched on and receiving electricity.
Check that all Ethernet cables are firmly connected.
Verify modem cables are securely plugged in.





4. Can my router overheat and cause network issues?
Yes. If your router disconnects frequently or behaves unpredictably:
Turn it off and let it cool down.
Ensure proper ventilation and move it to a cooler location.
If too many devices are connected, consider adding a second router to distribute the load.






5. Why is my Wi-Fi signal weak or unstable?
Wi-Fi signal limitations can cause connectivity issues. Potential causes include:
Physical barriers: Walls and furniture can block signals.
Interference: Devices like microwaves and garage door openers can disrupt the signal.
Neighboring networks: If multiple Wi-Fi networks are nearby, change your router's Wi-Fi channel.
Distance: Move closer to the router or reposition it for better coverage.






6. How do I improve my Wi-Fi signal strength?
Change your Wi-Fi channel to reduce interference.
Relocate your router to a central location.
Upgrade to a dual-band router to use the 5 GHz band for less interference.







7. How can I prevent my router from becoming outdated?
Periodically replace your router as older models may fail.
Keep a backup router and spare cables for emergencies.
Check for firmware updates, as they can improve stability and fix issues.





8. How do I update my router’s firmware?
Log into your router’s settings via a web browser.
Look for the "Firmware Update" section.
Download and install any available updates from the manufacturer.






9. How can I reduce Wi-Fi congestion in a crowded area?
Use the 5 GHz Wi-Fi band if supported.
Reduce the number of devices connected at once.
Enable Quality of Service (QoS) settings on your router to prioritize important traffic.






10. What should I do if my home network frequently drops connections?
Restart the router and modem.
Check for interference from household devices.
Ensure your router firmware is up to date.
Consider upgrading to a more powerful router.
